# Automatic_Plant_Watering_System
The Automatic Plant Watering System uses an Arduino to monitor soil moisture via a sensor. If the soil is dry, a relay activates a water pump, and once moisture is sufficient, the pump turns off, preventing overwatering. This ensures plants stay hydrated without manual intervention, making it ideal for busy or forgetful plant owners.
